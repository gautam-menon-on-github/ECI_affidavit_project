Coding Task – Candidate Affidavit Data Extraction

Objective:
 Write a Python script that automates the extraction of candidate affidavit data from the Election Commission of India’s affidavit portal.


Steps (Guidelines, not strict instructions):

1.	Visit ECI Affidavit Portal.
a.	Select any election, type, state, etc., and apply filters.

2.	Download 10 candidate affidavits (in English only).

3.	Extract key details from each affidavit:
a.	Candidate Name
b.	PAN
c.	Address
d.	Total amount of money declared

4.	Save the results in a structured JSON file.

Important Requirements:
1.	Perform Step 3 twice:
a.	Using open-source libraries such as OpenCV, Fitz, PDFplumber, etc.
b.	Using an LLM’s API of your choice.

2.	Affidavits come in multiple languages; process only the English ones.
3.	Think beyond the given steps; optimize the workflow. For example:
a.	You don’t need to extract the candidate’s name from the affidavit if it’s already available on the website (scraping can save effort).
b.	You may find faster or smarter ways to achieve the goal.

Sample JSON Output Format:
[
  {
    "candidate_name": "John Doe",
    "pan": "ABCDE1234F",
    "address": "123, Example Street, Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh",
    "total_assets": "₹ 5,00,000"
  },
  {
    "candidate_name": "Jane Smith",
    "pan": "XYZPQ5678K",
    "address": "45, Demo Colony, Indore, Madhya Pradesh",
    "total_assets": "₹ 12,50,000"
  }
]
